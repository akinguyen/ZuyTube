ZuyTube is my first PHP project which is inspired by Youtube. This website is a clone version of Youtube and has complete functionalities such as home page, subscribe, like, dislike, post videos, post comments, thumbnails, trending videos, upload, login, signup, edit videos, etc. 
The database is MySQL and stores the video information

In order to launch the project, download MAMP server and clone the project under the htdocs directory
